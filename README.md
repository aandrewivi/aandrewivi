# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Andrew Ivi

I'm currently an Operations Manager in the oil & gas industry, now transitioning into **cloud computing**, **DevOps**, and **system design**.

This GitHub is my digital learning portfolio — where I build and document **real-world cloud projects** across AWS and Azure, with hands-on CI/CD using GitHub Actions.


## 🌟 Cloud Projects

- `JotIt-App` → a cloud-native note-taking app across Azure & AWS
- (More projects coming soon...)


## 💼 Oil & Gas + Tech Fusion

My long-term goal is to drive innovation in the energy space using cloud-native tools, automation, and smart system design.
